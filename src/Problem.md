Triangular arbitrage (also referred to as cross currency arbitrage or three-point arbitrage) is the act of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity resulting from a pricing discrepancy among three different currencies in the foreign exchange market. Our task is to create a screen that helps us take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity by giving us BUY/SELL signals.
Additional Notes:
You are given: a REST API which has the list of currency pairs : https://restsimulator.intuhire.com/currency_pairs. You are also given a Websocket that simulates stock data wss://stocksimulator.intuhire.com. After connecting, you can start receiving data by sending a json message of the form {"currencyPair":"EURUSD"}. Your task is to design a screen similar to the one shown in the screenshot. There are 3 boxes (A, B and C going from left to right) , each belonging to a currency pair that can be selected from its dropdown. In FX markets, 1 pip is defined as 1/10000 i.e 0.0001. There is also an entry box that sets the number of pips as input (Lets call it N) .
 If the value of prices (A/B)-C < -N, the button on the bottom of the screen needs to say 'BUY' with a green background as shown in the screen shot. Conversely, If the value of prices (A/B)-C > N, the button needs to say 'SELL' with a red background. If the value of (A/B)-C is between N and -N the button needs to be greyed out with no text.
